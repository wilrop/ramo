# Ramo
Ramo is an algorithmic game theory framework offering a collection of algorithms and utilities for computing or learning (approximate) equilibria in multi-objective games.

Please visit [Ramo's docs](https://ramo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a complete overview of the framework and its capabilities.

## Installation
Installing Ramo is as easy as typing
````python
pip install ramo
````

If you would like to install from source, simply download this project as a zip file and place the folder at your desired location.

## Contributing
We are building a library containing cutting edge research in multi-objective game theory. If you are working in this area and want to get involved, contributions are very welcome! Our focus is specifically on multi-objective games, but single-objective contributions are also welcome. If you are considering contributing, please send me a message (willem.ropke@vub.be) so we can discuss how to move forward.
