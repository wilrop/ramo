This framework contains a number of state of the art algorithms that have been independently developed by other researchers. We present here a link to the original resources and citations.

## Preference Communication in Multi-Objective Normal-Form Games
This work developed several communication protocols. Specifically:
- Self-interested communication
- Cooperative action communication
- Cooperative policy communication
- Hierarchical policy communication
