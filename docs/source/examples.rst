Examples
=====================
Ramo currently contains more than 10 different algorithms capable of computing or learning (approximate) equilibria in multi-objective games. The following tables give an overview of our current algorithms, the equilibria they aim to find and the utility functions they support.

Example 1: Computing pure strategy Nash equilibria
